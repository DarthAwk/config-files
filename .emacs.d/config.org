* Emacs Configuration in Org Mode
This configuration is written in org mode. This relies on the init.el
file using org-babel to parse out the embedded emacs lisp code in this
file and loading it into emacs.

See an example of emacs lisp code block delimited between ~begin_src~
and ~end_src~ blocks. The ~begin_src~ declaration needs the language
to be declared and for emacs this is ~emacs-lisp~

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; babel needs at least one source block to prevent an error
;; when parsing this file
#+end_src

* Packages
** Magit

Magit describes itself as a porcelain for git.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package magit
  :ensure t
  :bind ("C-x g" . magit-status))
#+end_src
