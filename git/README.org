#+TITLE: Useful GIT configuration options

* Global Ignores

Tired of setting up editor swap files or Mac DSStore files in all of
your git projects.
The solution is to create a global gitignore that operates across all
of your projects in addition to each projects custom .gitignore

Convention is for your global gitignore file to be in
~$HOME/.gitignore_global~.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
#+END_SRC

* Creating global hooks

By default the hooks directory is $GIT_DIR/hooks, but that can be
changed via the core.hooksPath configuration variable.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git config core.hooksPath </path/to/my/centralized/hooks>
#+END_SRC

This repo has a hooks directory with the purpose being you can set
your core.HooksPath to point to it and gain the benefits of checking
for things such as innapropriate whitespace on precommit globally for
all projects.
